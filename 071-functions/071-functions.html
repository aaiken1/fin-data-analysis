# Getting setup

Open up your R Project for this class. You can do this under File:Open Project or in the upper right corner of RStudio. Then, do New File:RScript. Note that there is a keyboard shortcut. You can save this script `Lec71.r`. No data for this lecture - we will create our own where needed.


```r
library(tidyverse)
```

You will also see a little bit about functions in the **Intermediate R for Finance** DataCamp module. [Chapter 19](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/functions.html) of our textbook covers writing your own functions. Definitely more than we are going to cover.

# Why functions?

Automate common tasks in a power powerful and general way than copy-and-pasting:
- You can give a function an evocative name that makes your code easier to understand.
- As requirements change, you only need to update code in one place, instead of many.
- You eliminate the chance of making incidental mistakes when you copy and paste 
    - (i.e. updating a variable name in one place, but not in another).

## When should you write a function?

Whenever you’ve copied and pasted a block of code more than twice.

# Step-by-step

Let's look at some individual pieces of code before writing a simple return function. This example is from DataCamp. Let's also take a second and talk about **vectorization**.

.code-small[

```r
prices &lt;- c(23.4, 23.8, 22.3) # 23.4 = earliest price
diff(prices) # What does this do?
```

```
## [1]  0.4 -1.5
```

```r
prices[2] - prices[1]
```

```
## [1] 0.4
```

```r
prices[-3] # What does this do?
```

```
## [1] 23.4 23.8
```

```r
prices[-length(prices)] # What does this do?
```

```
## [1] 23.4 23.8
```

```r
diff(prices) / prices[-length(prices)] # What does this do?
```

```
## [1]  0.01709402 -0.06302521
```

```r
(23.4 - 23.8)/23.4
```

```
## [1] -0.01709402
```

# Turn your code into a function

- Pick a short but informative **name**, preferably a verb.
- List inputs, or **arguments**, to the function inside `function`. If we had more the call would look like `function(x, y, z)`.
- Place the **code** you have developed in body of the function, a `{` block that immediately follows `function(...)`.


```r
arith_returns &lt;- function(x) {
diff(x) / x[-length(x)]
}
arith_returns(prices)
```

```
## [1]  0.01709402 -0.06302521
```

# Example: A DCF function

Here's a function that calculates the discounted value of a series of cash flows. The function itself is a bit flexible. It can take a different interest rate for each cash flow, or just use a constant rate. You can also switch when the first cash flow occurs, just like in Excel.


```r
dcf &lt;- function(x, r, t0=FALSE){
  # calculates discounted cash flows (DCF) given cash flow and discount rate
  # x - cash flows vector
  # r - vector or discount rates, in decimals. Single values will be recycled
  # t0 - cash flow starts in year 0, default is FALSE, 
    # i.e. discount rate in first period is zero.
  if(length(r)==1){
    r &lt;- rep(r, length(x))
    if(t0==TRUE){r[1]&lt;-0}
  }
  x/cumprod(1+r)
}
```
---
# Example: A DCF function (cont.)
The `if` statement works just like the one in Excel. If we only give the function a single interest rate, then the function creates a vector `r` the same length as the number of cash flows with the single interest in every spot. `rep` means replicate If the first cash flow is at Time 0, then the function overwrites the first interest rate in the vector with 0. This only needs to be done if a single interest rate is given, so that second `if` is inside the first `if`.  We call that a nested `if`.

This function is also an example of **vectorization** in R. A vectorized function works not just on a single value, but on a **whole vector** of values at the same time. *x* is a vector of cash flows. *r* is a vector of discount rates. `cumprod` is the cumulative product function. 

So, x/cumprod(1+r) is actually doing:

x[1]/(1+r[1]), x[2]/((1+r[1])\*(1+r[2])), x[3]/((1+r[1])\*(1+r[2])\*(1+r[3]))



```r
dcf(c(100,100,200), 0.08)
```

```
## [1]  92.59259  85.73388 158.76645
```

# Example: Confidence intervals 
Here's an example from our textbook. Let's compute the confidence interval around a mean using a normal approximation. The first argument of the function is *x*, with just needs to be a numeric vector (e.g. a numeric column from a tibble). The second argument is *conf*, or the confidence interval. We've set a default value of the confidence interval to 0.95, though the user can change that.

What does `length` do? Remember `c`? How about `qnorm`?


```r
mean_ci &lt;- function(x, conf = 0.95) {
  se &lt;- sd(x) / sqrt(length(x))
  alpha &lt;- 1 - conf
  mean(x) + se * qnorm(c(alpha / 2, 1 - alpha / 2))
}
```

---
# Example: Confidence intervals (cont.)
"Confidence intervals are constructed at a confidence level, such as 95 %, selected by the user. What does this mean? It means that if the same population is sampled on numerous occasions and interval estimates are made on each occasion, the resulting intervals would bracket the true population parameter in approximately 95 % of the cases. A confidence stated at a 1−α level can be thought of as the inverse of a significance level, α."

.code-small[

```r
my_data &lt;- enframe(rnorm(1000))
mean_ci(my_data$value, 0.95)
```

```
## [1] -0.08395939  0.03707127
```

```r
qnorm(0.05/2) #The value of my variable such that 2.5% of the data lies to the left.
```

```
## [1] -1.959964
```

```r
pnorm(-1.959964) #What percent of my data lies to the left of -1.96?
```

```
## [1] 0.025
```

# Naming functions

&gt; "There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things." - Phil Karlton


- Names should be short but clearly evoke what the function does

- Names should be verbs, not nouns

- Multi-word names should be separated by underscores (`snake_case` as opposed to `camelCase`)

- A family of functions should be named similarly (`scrape_title`, `scrape_episode`, `scrape_genre`, etc.)

- Avoid overwriting existing (especially widely used) functions

# For next class...

- You will work on Lab #4.
- We are going to turn to some more "computer science"-like topics next. These means writing our own functions, loops, and vectorization. These are also lightly covered in the **Intermediate R for Finance** DataCamp module.
- Make sure that you are reading along in our textbook. We aren't covering every part of every chapter, but there are tools in the book that will help you out later on.
- The **Intermediate R for Finance** DataCamp module is due Monday 3/18 at midnight.
