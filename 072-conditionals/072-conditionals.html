# Getting setup

Open up your R Project for this class. You can do this under File:Open Project or in the upper right corner of RStudio. Then, do New File:RScript. Note that there is a keyboard shortcut. You can save this script `Lec72.r`. No data for this lecture - we will create our own where needed.


```r
library(tidyverse)
```

You will also see a little bit about functions in the **Intermediate R for Finance** DataCamp module. [Chapter 21](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html#introduction-14) of our textbook covers loops and itertation. There are some powerful tools in that chapter, such as `purrr` that are the `tidy` way to do the `apply` functions covered in DataCamp.

# Style guide

&gt;"Good coding style is like correct punctuation: you can manage without it, butitsuremakesthingseasiertoread."
&gt;
&gt;Hadley Wickham

- Style guide for this course is based on the Tidyverse style guide: http://style.tidyverse.org/
- There's more to it than what we'll cover today, but we'll mention more as we introduce more functionality, and do a recap later in the semester

---
# More on names

### File names and code chunk labels

- Do not use spaces in file names, use `-` or `_` to separate words
- Use all lowercase letters

.code-small[

```r
# Good
stock-returns.csv

# Bad
Stock Returns.csv
```
]

### Object names

- Use `_` to separate words in object names
- Use informative but short object names
- Do not reuse object names within an analysis

.code-small[

```r
# Good
acs_employed

# Bad
acs.employed
acs2
```
]
---

# Spacing

- Put a space before and after all infix operators (=, +, -, &lt;-, etc.), and when naming arguments in function calls. 
- Always put a space after a comma, and never before (just like in regular English).


```r
# Good
average &lt;- mean(feet / 12 + inches, na.rm = TRUE)

# Bad
average&lt;-mean(feet/12+inches,na.rm=TRUE)
```

- Limit your code to 80 characters per line. This fits comfortably on a printed page with a reasonably sized font.
- Take advantage of RStudio editor's auto formatting for indentation at line breaks.

---

# ggplot

- Always end a line with `+`
- Always indent the next line


```r
# Good
ggplot(diamonds, mapping = aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram()

# Bad
ggplot(diamonds,mapping=aes(x=price))+geom_histogram()
```

---

# Quotes

Use `"`, not `'`, for quoting text. The only exception is when the text already contains double quotes and no single quotes.


```r
ggplot(diamonds, mapping = aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  # Good
  labs(title = "`Shine bright like a diamond`",
  # Good
       x = "Diamond prices",
  # Bad
       y = 'Frequency')
```

# Conditionals and Iteration in R

A **conditional statement** will take the form of: IF TRUE, THEN DO THIS, ELSE DO THAT. Using tools like `dplyr` make this less common that in the past.

We also want to reduce **duplication** in our R code, espectially as we get more advanced. One tool for reducing duplication is **functions**, which reduce duplication by identifying repeated patterns of code and extract them out into independent pieces that can be easily reused and updated. Another tool for reducing duplication is **iteration**, which helps you when you need to do the same thing to multiple inputs: repeating the same operation on different columns, or on different datasets. 

The traditional way to do iteration in programing is through **loops**. We will also talk about some R specific ways to iterate. These are called `funcational` in the text. Examples include the `apply` family of functions from DataCamp and the `purrr` package. The latter takes some getting use to, so don't worry if it seems strange at first.

# IF Statement


```r
random &lt;- rnorm(1)
if(random &gt; 0) {
  print(c(random, "is pretty big"))
} else {
  print(c(random, "is pretty small"))
}
```

```
## [1] "-0.451806226868241" "is pretty small"
```

From DataCamp, you may have noticed that `IF` + `subset()` is basically a `ddplyr::filter`. `ddplyr` has there own IF statements, such as `if_else`. These are easy to use as part of a %&gt;%.

If you start to have a bunch of `IF` statements, probably worth thinking more about what you're trying to do.

# Looping with FOR
This is **old school R**. Generate 45 days of log returns from normal distribution. Count number of times the price gets below 950,000. Let's do this 100,000 times.


```r
niter &lt;- 100000  # Number of Iterations is 100,000
below &lt;- rep(0, niter)  # Set up storage
set.seed(2009)

for (i in 1:niter) {
	r &lt;- rnorm(45, mean = 0.05/253, sd = .23/sqrt(253))
	log.Price &lt;- log(1000000) + cumsum(r)
	min.log.Price &lt;- min(log.Price) 
	below[i] &lt;- as.numeric(exp(min.log.Price) &lt; 950000) 
}

a &lt;- mean(below)
a
```

```
## [1] 0.50988
```

DataCamp covers `repeate` and `while` loops. Looping over a list can be helpful.

# Functional Methods

# The purrr package
`For` loops are not as important in R as they are in other languages because R is a functional programming language. This means that it’s possible to wrap up for loops in a function, and call that function instead of using the for loop directly.

Let's start with the `map` functions from the `purrr` package. This is the `tidy` way to avoid looping. In the DataCamp lectures, they cover the older, but still used, `apply` family of functions.

The goal of using `purrr` functions instead of for loops is to allow you break common list manipulation challenges into independent pieces:

1. How can you solve the problem for a single element of the list? Once you’ve solved that problem, `purrr` takes care of generalising your solution to every element in the list.

2. If you’re solving a complex problem, how can you break it down into bite-sized pieces that allow you to advance one small step towards a solution? With `purrr`, you get lots of small pieces that you can compose together with the pipe.

---
# The purrr package (cont.)
The pattern of looping over a vector, doing something to each element and saving the results is so common that the purrr package provides a family of functions to do it for you. There is one function for each type of output:

- map() makes a list.
- map_lgl() makes a logical vector.
- map_int() makes an integer vector.
- map_dbl() makes a double vector.
- map_chr() makes a character vector.
- map_if() can do conditionals.

You give **map** a function (e.g. mean). It will then do that over all of the specified columns (variables). So, a lot like a loop!

We need the `.` and the `~` here. See [this Stack Overflow page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44834446/what-is-meaning-of-first-tilde-in-purrrmap) for more on this syntax. The `~` let's us "write" a function inside the `map` function. The `.` is a placeholder for all of the columns that will be arguments of that function. Here's what cool - this code will work for any data frame with numeric data. Note that there's nothing about variable names!

# The purrr package (cont.)

Let's run a simple regression on our housing data for the non-waterfront homes. Note that I am putting all of this into m1 (a list which contains the output from the regression), but that I'm doing this at **the end of the pipe**. You can do this too!

```r
house %&gt;%
  filter(waterfront == 0) %&gt;%
  lm(log(price) ~ log(sqft_living), data = .) -&gt; m1

# The purrr package (cont.)

Let's `split` our data into two groups by the *waterfront* variable. Then we'll use map to run a regression on each group. The output is too large to show on the slide.


```r
house %&gt;%
  split(.$waterfront) %&gt;%
  map(~ lm(log(price) ~ log(sqft_living), data = .)) %&gt;%
  map(summary)
```

# The apply functions

These are covered a little bit in the **Intermediate R for Finance** DataCamp. I don't want to go into great detail, but again be aware that these things exist. We'll look at the basic `apply` first. Remember, this is not `tidyverse` - it is older R.

apply(X, MARGIN, FUN)
- x: a data frame or matrix
- MARGIN:  take a value or range between 1 and 2 to define where to apply the function
  - MARGIN=1: the manipulation is performed on rows
  - MARGIN=2: the manipulation is performed on columns
  - MARGIN=c(1,2) the manipulation is performed on rows and columns
- FUN: tells which function to apply. Built-in functions like mean, median, sum, min, max and even user-defined functions can be applied.

---
# The apply functions (cont.)

Let's try a simple `apply` on the housing data. We'll mix in some `tidyverse`.


```r
house %&gt;%
  select(bedrooms, bathrooms) %&gt;%
  apply(., 2, mean) # the . is in place of the data frame
```

```
##  bedrooms bathrooms 
##  3.370842  2.114757
```


```r
house %&gt;%
  select(bedrooms, bathrooms) %&gt;%
  apply(., 2, function(x) sum(is.na(.))) 
```

```
##  bedrooms bathrooms 
##         0         0
```

---
# The apply functions (cont.)

Let's try `lapply`. This one returns a `list` and doesn't need the `margin`. It will just work for each column. A `list` is another type of object in R that can contain multiple things. This example takes every column in tickers and does the `tolower` function to all elements in that column. There are 4 columns, but only 1 element in each column.


```r
tickers &lt;- c("AAPL","NFLX","MSFT","IBM")
tickers_lower &lt;- lapply(tickers, tolower)
glimpse(tickers_lower)
```

```
## List of 4
##  $ : chr "aapl"
##  $ : chr "nflx"
##  $ : chr "msft"
##  $ : chr "ibm"
```

---
# The apply functions (cont.)

Let's try `sapply`. This one returns a `vector` and also doesn't need the `margin`. It will just work for each column. See the DataCamp lecture for more `sapply` and `vapply`. They are all very similar. There are slight differences in syntax and in what is returned after the functions are run(e.g. vector vs. list).


```r
tickers &lt;- c("AAPL","NFLX","MSFT","IBM")
tickers_lower &lt;- sapply(tickers, tolower)
glimpse(tickers_lower) 
```

```
##  Named chr [1:4] "aapl" "nflx" "msft" "ibm"
##  - attr(*, "names")= chr [1:4] "AAPL" "NFLX" "MSFT" "IBM"
```

# A last word

You can do a lot more with these ideas, but they quickly go beyond the scope of this semester. This important point: **remember that they exist, as you may see them used when you look for help online.** Why use them? If you find your self repeating code.

But, correct code &gt;&gt;&gt; efficient code at this point. 

### For next class...
- You will work on Lab #5.
- The **Intermediate R for Finance** DataCamp module is due Monday 3/18 at midnight.
- More mid-term exam is next week. More details to follow.
