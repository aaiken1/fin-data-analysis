# Getting setup

Open up your R Project for this class. You can do this under File:Open Project or in the upper right corner of RStudio. Then, do New File:RScript. Note that there is a keyboard shortcut. You can save this script `Lec10.r`.


```r
library(tidyverse)
library(xts)
library(tidyquant)
library(PerformanceAnalytics)
library(here)
library(RcppRoll)
library(janitor)
```

- We are going to start with the `xts` package today. This is a very popular "old school" R package for handling **time series data** (e.g. stock prices and returns). It is also the subject of your **a DataCamp module that we are doing**. 

- We will then turn to a `tidayquant` example. `xts` is also part of the `tidyquant` package. This means that we can use the `xts` functions, but as part of a `tidyquant` function. This let's us do old school R finance stuff, but with a `tidy` flavor. So why learn the traditional way? `tidyquant` is very new and most of finance R still uses traditional `xts`.

# Getting our data



```r
etf &lt;- read_csv(here::here("10-xts-basics", "data", "etf-reproducible-finance.csv"))
```

```
## Parsed with column specification:
## cols(
##   date = col_date(format = ""),
##   SPY = col_double(),
##   EFA = col_double(),
##   IJS = col_double(),
##   EEM = col_double(),
##   AGG = col_double()
## )
```

- Let's read in our ETF data that we looked at a while back. This data is in a traditional **time series** format, with each column representing a security. This is **not** an `xts` object yet, though.

- By telling R that data is an `xts` object, we are telling R that we can do some special functions that are part of the `xts` package. These functions are common things that you would want to do to time series data, like go from daily to monthly, pull certain periods, or create *rolling* calculations.

# Getting our data (cont.)


```r
ff &lt;- read_csv(here::here("10-xts-basics", "data", "ff_daily.csv"))
```

```
## Parsed with column specification:
## cols(
##   date = col_double(),
##   mktrf = col_double(),
##   smb = col_double(),
##   hml = col_double(),
##   rf = col_double()
## )
```

```r
ff &lt;- ff %&gt;% 
  mutate(date = ymd(parse_date_time(date, "%Y%m%d")))
```

-Let's also bring in some daily FF factor returns that I've already cleaned up for you. The `mutate` is to fix the date.

# Creating an xts object

We have some **times series** data in R now, but is is not an `xts` object. Let's tell R that we want it to treat this as an `xts` object. Easy - just use type coercion! There is also an `xts::xts` function that creates an `xts` object from scratch. You'll see this in the DataCamp module.


```r
etf &lt;- as.xts(etf[,-1], order.by = etf$date)
class(etf)
```

```
## [1] "xts" "zoo"
```

```r
ff &lt;- as.xts(ff[,-1], order.by = ff$date)
```

This code is saying take all columns but the first one and make these our time series. Then, take the **date** column and make that our **index**. Open up the `xts` object and you'll see that **date** is there, but it doesn't have a column name. It isn't a regular variable anymore! This is time series data, so the date is the most important part.

Why create the `xts` object, rather than just keep the data as a `data frame` or `tibble`? By telling R that this an `xts` object, we can use special functions on it.

---
# Subsetting xts data


```r
first(etf[index(etf) &gt; "2017-01-01"], "5 days")
```

```
##                 SPY      EFA      IJS      EEM      AGG
## 2017-01-03 220.0632 56.56463 138.5010 34.74012 104.5313
## 2017-01-04 221.3724 57.20730 141.0436 35.00487 104.5603
## 2017-01-05 221.1965 57.69417 138.6188 35.38727 104.9952
## 2017-01-06 221.9879 57.49942 137.8825 35.24019 104.6473
## 2017-01-09 221.2552 57.41178 136.4296 35.21078 104.8212
```

Note the square brackets. This is because we are pulling data from the object *etf*. Parentheses are for functions. R is checking if our condition is true and giving us those observations. `xts` also has the `xts::first` and `xts::last` functions. They are like `head` and `tail`, but they understand time intervals.

# Subsetting xts data (cont.)

Use `/` for a range of dates.


```r
first(etf["2013-01-01/2013-01-31"], "5 days")
```

```
##                 SPY      EFA      IJS      EEM      AGG

# Subsetting xts data (cont.)

You can even **nest** `first` and `last`. The `last` goes first, so you pull out the last two months. Then, you get the `first` five days of that period.


```r
first(last(etf, "2 months"), "5 days")
```

```
##                 SPY      EFA      IJS      EEM      AGG

# Merging with xts

Just like our other joins/mergers. Note the differences between *outer*, *inner*, *left*, and *right*. Look at the file size differences!


```r
outer_data &lt;- merge.xts(etf, ff, fill = "NA", join ="outer")
inner_data &lt;- merge.xts(etf, ff, fill = "NA", join ="inner")
left_data &lt;- merge.xts(etf, ff, fill = "NA", join ="left")
right_data &lt;- merge.xts(etf, ff, fill = "NA", join ="right")
```
- left merge: only observations in the left data set
- right merge: only observations in the right data set
- outer merge: all observations 
- inner merger: only observations in both sets

DataCamp uses `merge`, but you want to use`merge.xts`. See DataCamp module for additional ways to handle **missing values**.

---
# Lags and Differences

Two of the most common things you might want to do with time series data is create **lagged** values or to take **differences**. We've seen this with `dplyr` already. These are standard **time series operators**


```r
etf_lag1 &lt;- lag.xts(etf, k = 1, na.pad = TRUE)
etf_diff &lt;- diff.xts(etf, lag = 1, differences = 1, arithmetic = TRUE, na.pad = TRUE)
```

Compare *etf*, *etf_lag1*, and *etf_diff* to see what happened.

---
# Applying functions by time

This is where `xts` really starts to be useful. The idea of a date is at the core of the package, so there are many different built-in functions. You can apply functions (e.g. mean) over certain periods of time (e.g. monthly).

**INDEX** is a vector of end dates. We can use the `endpoints` function to pull out the end-of-year (or month, or week, etc.) dates from our data.


```r
period.apply(x, INDEX, FUN, ...)
endpoints(x, on = "years")
```


```r
end_of_week_points &lt;- endpoints(etf, on = "weeks")
last(period.apply(etf, INDEX = end_of_week_points, FUN = median), "3 weeks")
```

```
##                [,1]
## 2017-12-15 108.1783
## 2017-12-22 107.6444
## 2017-12-28 107.9905
```

Note that function can be *any* R function (including one your write) that makes sense in context.

---
# Applying functions by time (cont.)

There is also a useful `split.xts` function. It creates a **list** for each date group. This is why you are seeing double brackets. Here I am pulling the first 10 days of the 17 month in the data.


```r
etf_by_month &lt;- split.xts(etf, f = "months")
first(etf_by_month[[17]], "10 days")
```

```
##                 SPY      EFA      IJS      EEM      AGG

# Converting periods

Let's say you wanted to pull month end data for the 4th column of the ETF data (the AGG ETF). The `to.period` function looks within each period and gets you the opening value, the high, the low, and the closing value. The **name** argument tells the function what to put before .open, .high, etc.


```r
first(to.period(etf["2013/2014", 4], "months", name = "AGG"), "5 months")
```

```
##            AGG.Open AGG.High  AGG.Low AGG.Close
## 2013-01-31 40.67489 40.67489 39.44259  39.77539
## 2013-02-28 40.03624 40.03624 38.40817  38.86691
## 2013-03-28 38.95686 39.69444 37.59863  38.47113
## 2013-04-30 38.05737 38.93888 36.75312  38.93888
## 2013-05-31 38.51611 39.78439 37.05894  37.05894
```

# Rolling functions

First, let's convert our prices into daily log returns. I'm going to "cheat" and use a function from the `PerformanceAnalytics` package.


```r
etf_daily_rets &lt;- Return.calculate(etf, method = "log") %&gt;% na.omit()
```

*etf_daily_rets* is still an `xts` object. Now, let's use the split/apply/bind methodology. The `tidy` way has meant that we've avoided this, but it is useful to see.


```r
etf_monthly_rets &lt;- split(etf_daily_rets[, 4], f = "months")
etf_monthly_rets &lt;- lapply(etf_monthly_rets, cumsum)
etf_monthly_rets &lt;- do.call(rbind, etf_monthly_rets)
```

What did we just do? We `splt` the EEM ETF out into a **list**, where each month observations is a separate element of that list. Then, we used `lapply` to do a **cumulative sum** of all returns for each month in the list. This gives us the **total monthly return to that point in time**. Finally, we used `do.call` and `rbind` to combine the elements in our list back together and create an `xts` object once again. `do.call` is a little trick that lets us avoid having to list out each element of the list to `rbind`. It just does them all.

---
# Rolling functions (cont.)
The `rollapply` function let's us use rolling windows. Think things like **moving averages**. This example picks out the EEM ETF and calculates 3 day rolling averages of log returns. You can certainly use this method to start to calculate things like 200-day moving averages, but there are actually packages already created for your technical trading needs.


```r
first(rollapply(etf_daily_rets[, 4], 3, mean), "10 days")
```

```
##                     EEM
## 2013-01-02           NA
## 2013-01-03           NA

# Intro to tidyquant

The `tidyquant` package is mainted by [Matt Dancho](https://business-science.github.io/tidyquant/) and brings several different finance-specific R packages into one, `tidy`-friendly package. These packages include `zoo` and `xts` for manipulating time series data, `quantmod` to download and analyze returns, `ttr` for technical analysis, and `PerformanceAnalytics` for return attribution and risk measurement.

This means that `tidyquant` wants long data (date and symbol are columns), rather than wide data (each symbol is its own column). It also has its own version of mutate and transmute, and plays well with `%&gt;%`s. 

Here's the [CRAN page](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyquant/index.html) and the [first vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyquant/vignettes/TQ00-introduction-to-tidyquant.html) for `tidyquant`.

You've already seen a few `tidyquant` functions in the labs, but let's go over a few more.

---
# tidyquant


```r
google &lt;- tq_get(x = "GOOG")
names(google)
```

```
## [1] "date"     "open"     "high"     "low"      "close"    "volume"   "adjusted"
```

```r
head(google)
```

```
## # A tibble: 6 x 7
##   date        open  high   low close   volume adjusted
##   &lt;date&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;

## 6 2010-01-11  301.  301.  296.  299. 14479800     299.
```

We have see `tq_get` already. Here we are just pulling one ticker. You can omitt the `x=` part and give a list of tickers instead. Try ?tq_get in the console to read more. 


---
# Data Sources in tidyquant


```r
tq_get_options()
```

```
##  [1] "stock.prices"        "stock.prices.google" "stock.prices.japan" 
##  [4] "financials"          "key.ratios"          "dividends"          
##  [7] "splits"              "economic.data"       "exchange.rates"     
## [10] "metal.prices"        "quandl"              "quandl.datatable"   
## [13] "alphavantager"       "rblpapi"
```

Above are the data sources available to `tidyquant`. You can get a lot more than just stock prices.


```r
wti_price_usd &lt;- tq_get("DCOILWTICO", get = "economic.data")
head(wti_price_usd, 3)
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 3
##   symbol     date       price
##   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;date&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 DCOILWTICO 2010-01-01  NA  
## 2 DCOILWTICO 2010-01-04  81.5
## 3 DCOILWTICO 2010-01-05  81.7
```

# Using tq_transmute

`tq_transmute` is a powerful way to manipulate financial data. Here, we are taking the FANG data built-in to the `tidyquant` package, taking the adjusted close, and picking the last close of each month. Note that `transmute` drops everything but the columns used as part of the transmute. In this case, we are doing a `group_by(symbol)`, so the tickers are kept in the data. Do you see what `group_by()` does when used with `slice()`?


```r
FANG %&gt;%
    group_by(symbol) %&gt;%
    tq_transmute(select = adjusted, mutate_fun = to.monthly, indexAt = "lastof") %&gt;%
    slice(1:2)
```

```
## # A tibble: 8 x 3
## # Groups:   symbol [4]
##   symbol date       adjusted
##   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;date&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 AMZN   2013-01-31    266.

# Using tq_mutate

`tq_mutate` will create a new variable and keep the existing ones in the tibble. There are many different built-in mutate functions. In this case, let's create a [MACD indicator](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macd.asp) using the closing price. We can then rename the column from "MACD" to "Signal". I'm "slicing" the last row for each stock.


```r
FANG %&gt;%
    group_by(symbol) %&gt;%
    tq_mutate(select     = close, 
              mutate_fun = MACD, 
              col_rename = c("MACD", "Signal")) %&gt;%
  slice(n())
```

```
## # A tibble: 4 x 10
## # Groups:   symbol [4]
##   symbol date        open  high   low close   volume adjusted   MACD Signal
##   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;date&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;

# Calculating returns

We can pull stock prices and calculate returns using `tidyverse` functions. For example, we can easily calculate weekly returns from prices.


```r
fb_returns &lt;- tq_get("FB", get  = "stock.prices", from = "2016-01-01", 
                     to   = "2016-12-31") %&gt;%
    tq_transmute(adjusted, periodReturn, period = "weekly", 
                 col_rename = "fb.returns")

xlk_returns &lt;- tq_get("XLK", from = "2016-01-01", 
                      to = "2016-12-31") %&gt;%
    tq_transmute(adjusted, periodReturn, period = "weekly", 
                 col_rename = "xlk.returns")

returns_combined &lt;- left_join(fb_returns, xlk_returns, by = "date")

head(returns_combined,3)
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 3
##   date       fb.returns xlk.returns
##   &lt;date&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 2016-01-08    -0.0478     -0.0516
## 2 2016-01-15    -0.0242     -0.0187
## 3 2016-01-22     0.0313      0.0264

# Graphing with tidyquant

```r
AAPL &lt;- tq_get("AAPL", get = "stock.prices", from = "2018-09-01", to = "2020-03-30")

end &lt;- as_date("2020-03-30")
```

Let's get some individual stock price set up. We'll use the `end`, a variable with a single date, when making our graphs.

# Graphing with tidyquant (cont.)


```r
AAPL %&gt;%
    ggplot(aes(x = date, y = close)) +
    geom_candlestick(aes(open = open, high = high, low = low, close = close)) +
    geom_ma(ma_fun = SMA, n = 50, linetype = 5, size = 1.25) +
    geom_ma(ma_fun = SMA, n = 200, color = "red", size = 1.25) + 
    labs(title = "AAPL Candlestick Chart", 
         subtitle = "50 and 200-Day SMA", 
         y = "Closing Price", x = "") + 
    coord_x_date(xlim = c(end - weeks(52), end),
                 ylim = c(175, 350)) + 
    theme_tq()
```
There are [many different ways to graph](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyquant/vignettes/TQ04-charting-with-tidyquant.html) in `tidyquant`. These methods extend `ggplot` and include things like `geom_candlestick` and `geom_ma`, shown above.

# The VIX and the S&amp;P 500

Let's follow along with an example from the [Reproducible Finance blog](http://www.reproduciblefinance.com/2019/08/06/summer-vix/), where we replicates part of a paper from folks at the hedge fund AQR. The paper looks at the relationship between the VIX and the S&amp;P 500. Seems relevant today! Back when this paper was written (2017), the VIX was very low. See the blog post for more on what the VIX is actually measuring.

**Our goal - follow along with the code**, as if you're reading something in a foreign language that you're studying. You are going to see things that you don't know yet. Make a note, see if you can figure out what it is doing, and then look it up. 

This is the **Part 2** example posted on Moodle. The earlier **Part 1** code is from before `tidayquant` was developed and uses another package called `quantmod`, which deals with `xts` objects, rather than `tibbles`.

As the author notes, by using certain functions, we can stay in the `tidyquant` world, instead of the `xts` world.
---
# The VIX and the S&amp;P 500 (cont.)


```r
symbols &lt;- c("^GSPC", "^VIX")
```

- Put the two tickers into a "vector" of characters. You could have number of tickers and use `c` to combine them together. This is better than putting the tickers directly into the function that downloads the data.


```r
prices_tq &lt;- 
  symbols %&gt;% 
  tq_get(get = "stock.prices", from = "1990-01-01")
```

- We get our returns the usual way using `tq_get` from the `tidyquant` package.

# The VIX and the S&amp;P 500 (cont.)


```r
sp500_vix_rolling_vol &lt;- 
  prices_tq %&gt;%  
  select(symbol, date, close) %&gt;% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = symbol, values_from = close) %&gt;% 
  janitor::clean_names() %&gt;% 
  mutate(sp500_returns = gspc/lag(gspc, 1) - 1,
         sp500_roll_20 = RcppRoll::roll_sd(sp500_returns, 20, 
                                           fill = NA, align = "right"),
         sp500_roll_20_annualized = 
           (round((sqrt(252) * sp500_roll_20 * 100), 2))) %&gt;% 
  na.omit()
```

- We want to calculate the rolling standard deviation of the S&amp;P 500. This means calculating the standard deviation from a moving window, in this case 20 days. So, at every point in time, take the last 20 days worth of returns and find the standard deviation. Then, move forward a day and do it again.

- We start by taking the price data and keeping just the things we need: symbol, date, and the closing price. We `pivot_wider` to have each symbol be its own column of prices. I use `pivot_wider`, rather than `spread`, as this is what we've been using in class. They get you to the same place.

# The VIX and the S&amp;P 500 (cont.)

```r
sp500_vix_rolling_vol &lt;- 
  prices_tq %&gt;%  
  select(symbol, date, close) %&gt;% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = symbol, values_from = close) %&gt;% 
  janitor::clean_names() %&gt;% 
  mutate(sp500_returns = gspc/lag(gspc, 1) - 1,
         sp500_roll_20 = RcppRoll::roll_sd(sp500_returns, 20, 
                                           fill = NA, align = "right"),
         sp500_roll_20_annualized = 
           (round((sqrt(252) * sp500_roll_20 * 100), 2))) %&gt;% 
  na.omit()
```

- `janitor::clean_names()` cleans up the column/variable names (e.g. adding _ between words). Very useful!

- Now the important part. Each symbol is its own column now. We can calculate returns doing (price t)/(price t-1) - 1. R makes this easy - **gspc** is the S&amp;P 500 ticker and is a **vector** of prices. Rather than create a loop, R lets us take the entire vector and divide each item in the vector by the previous item in the vector. This is what the `lag` function is doing. This is a nice example of what is called **vectorization** - you can just refer to the entire vector (i.e. column of prices) and do something to every item in it.

                                           fill = NA, align = "right"),
         sp500_roll_20_annualized = 
           (round((sqrt(252) * sp500_roll_20 * 100), 2))) %&gt;% 
  na.omit()
```

- The author is using `RcppRoll::roll_sd`, a very fast method.

- The first argument of `RcppRoll::roll_sd` is the variable to use. The next is the size of the window (20 days). Note that when you calculate a rolling window, you are going to have observations where this is impossible, since there isn't enough data to calculate yet. We are filling in these observations with missing values (NA). Finally, the `align = "right"` argument tells the function to start with the current value (the furthest right) and then look backwards to calculate. We are going to have missing values until we get 20 days into the sample.

           (round((sqrt(252) * sp500_roll_20 * 100), 2))) %&gt;% 
  na.omit()
```

- We can do an approximate annualizing of standard deviations (volatility in finance-speak) by taking the daily standard deviation and multiplying by the square root of the number of trading days in a year. He then multiplies by 100 so that 25 can be interpreted as 25%. The `round()` function gets rid of all of the decimal places that we don't need.

- Finally, he drops those initial observations where the window isn't long enough yet to calculate the rolling standard deviation.

# The VIX and the S&amp;P 500 (cont.)

```r
sp500_vix_rolling_vol %&gt;% 
  filter(date &gt;= Sys.Date() - months(3)) %&gt;% 
  ggplot(aes(x = sp500_roll_20_annualized, y = vix)) +
  geom_point(color = "cornflowerblue") +
  geom_smooth(method='lm', se = FALSE, color = "pink", size = .5) +
  ggtitle("Vix versus 20-Day Realized Vol") +
  xlab("Realized vol preceding 20 trading days") +
  ylab("Vix") +
  # Add a '%' sign to the axes without having to rescale.
  scale_y_continuous(labels = function(x){ paste0(x, "%") }) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = function(x){ paste0(x, "%") }, 
                     breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n=10)) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

- The rest of the code is exploring the relationship between **realized volatility**, the measure that we just calculated, and the **VIX**. This graph only shows the data for the last three months - `filter(date &gt;= Sys.Date() - months(3))`. 

- I dropped the `group_by`, as I don't see what it is doing and it slows things down.

- `function(x){ paste0(x, "%") }` is an example of a more advanced concept called an **anonymous function**. It just lets you quickly define a function and use it right away.

# The VIX and the S&amp;P 500 (cont.)

Finally, we can run a quick regression to formally test if the VIX is related to past realized volatility. We saw the relationship in the previous graph.
