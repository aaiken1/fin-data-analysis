# Getting setup

Open up your R Project for this class. You can do this under File:Open Project or in the upper right corner of RStudio. Then, do New File:RScript. Note that there is a keyboard shortcut. You can save this script `Lec14.r`.


```r
# next install blotter from GitHub
# devtools::install_github("braverock/blotter")
# next install quantstrat from GitHub
# devtools::install_github("braverock/quantstrat")

library(tidyverse)
library(quantmod)
library(TTR)
library(blotter)
library(quantstrat)
```

Let's load in our general set of R packages from the `tidyverse`. We are going to follow along with the `quantstrat` trading course on DataCamp. `TTR` and `blotter` are helper packages that you'll need to install using the `devtools::install_github` function. You'll probably need to install the `devtools` package as well.


---
# What should we trade?
How about the S&amp;P 500 ETF, **SPY**? Let's use `quantmod::getSymbols` to download our data from Yahoo!. `startdate` and `enddate` tell the function `getSymbols()` what time series to pull. `initdate` is going to be used by `quantstat` to set our initial portfolio date and settings. **It needs to be before the first date in your price data.**



```r
initdate &lt;- "1994-12-31"
startdate &lt;- "1995-01-01"
enddate &lt;- "2017-12-31"

getSymbols("SPY", from = startdate, to = enddate, src = "yahoo", adjusted = TRUE, verbose = FALSE)
```

```
## 'getSymbols' currently uses auto.assign=TRUE by default, but will
## use auto.assign=FALSE in 0.5-0. You will still be able to use
## 'loadSymbols' to automatically load data. getOption("getSymbols.env")
## and getOption("getSymbols.auto.assign") will still be checked for
## alternate defaults.
## 
## This message is shown once per session and may be disabled by setting 
## options("getSymbols.warning4.0"=FALSE). See ?getSymbols for details.
```

```
## [1] "SPY"
```

This will save the ticker data into an **xts** object called `SPY`. You can also use commands like `Op()`, `Hi()`, `Lo()`, `Ad()`, etc. to pull specific prices.
---

# Looking at our data
We can pull the Adjusted price from SPY and plot it using the base R `plot` function. Not a great looking graph, but you get the idea! This is an **xts** object, so you would need to convert it to a data frame or tibble before using `ggplot`.


```r
plot(Ad(SPY))
```

&lt;img src="14-trading_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

# How should we trade?

Quantitative trading like this needs an **indicator**. This indicator could be based on fundamentals, such as valuation screens (e.g. EV/EBITDA, P/CF) or quality measures (e.g. ROA, low debt burden). We are going to use technical trading rules, which are how many practitioners employ some kind of momentum strategy. Of course, there's nothing that says you can't combine these trading rules to have both fundamentals and technicals as part of your strategy.

The `TTR` package comes with many different technical trading rules ready to use. So, we don't have to do things like calculate the moving averages ourselves. Let's calculate a **simple 200-day moving average** using the closing prices of the SPY.


```r
sma &lt;- SMA(x = Cl(SPY), n = 200)
```

Take a look at the time-series this creates in the **sma** xts object. There should be 200 missing observations until you reach day 200. Then, you are using the previous 200 days to take an average. Then, move forward one day and do this again. That's a moving average.
---

# How should we trade? (cont.)
Note how I save the plot to my global environment and then add elements to it, kind of like with `ggplot`. 

```r
p &lt;- plot(Cl(SPY), main = "Daily SPY with 200 Day Moving Average")
p &lt;- lines(sma, col = "red")
p
```

&lt;/div&gt;

These notes will take you through the very basics of this process. They are by no means and comprehensive overview. I am following along with the DataCamp course and adding my own commentary as I go.

---
# Setting up quantstrat

You should see initdate as a string over in your global environment. We did this earlier, but it will tell `quantstrat` when to start and stop things. Make sure that your initdate is before the first closing price given in your data.


```r
# Set system environment timezone:
Sys.setenv(TZ = "UTC")

# Set currency (we’ll use USD for now):
currency("USD")
```

```
## [1] "USD"
```

```r
# Treat as basic equity
stock("SPY", currency = "USD", multiplier = 1)
```

```
## [1] "SPY"
```

---
# Setting up quantstrat (cont.)
We can name our strategy, portfolio, and account, the same thing. We will need to **intialize** our portfolio, account, orders, and strategy. Let's set up that we have $100,000 to invest. This will come in at the very end.


```r
initeq &lt;- 100000

# Remove previously run strategy if needed
# rm.strat(strategy.st)

strategy.st &lt;- portfolio.st &lt;- account.st &lt;- "firststrat"
```
**Important**: If you get into trouble and keep getting warnings that "such and such portfolio already exists", run that rm.strat() function with your strategy in the console. It deletes all of the "hidden" objects you've created with `quantstrat` and let's you start over. If that doesn't work, save your script, close R Studio, and open it back up again.

---
# Setting up quantstrat (cont.)
Let's start by initializing our **portfolio**. Think about this as setting up a place where we can store information about our portfolio. Our portfolio will start on a certain date, have a currency associated with it, etc.


```r
initPortf(portfolio.st, symbols = "SPY", initDate = initdate, currency = "USD")
```

```
## [1] "firststrat"
```

We can then set up our **account**. I think accounts can have multiple portfolios. You also tell your account how much money you have to start (i.e. initeq).


```r
initAcct(account.st, portfolios = portfolio.st, initDate = initdate, currency = "USD", initEq = initeq)
```

```
## [1] "firststrat"
```

---
# Setting up quantstrat (cont.)
Next up is our order book. We need a place to store the trades that we're going to make based on our signals. The order book requires a portfolio name and a start date.


```r
initOrders(portfolio.st, initDate = initdate)
```

Finally, we can initialize our strategy. 


```r
strategy(strategy.st, store = TRUE)
```

---
# Inspecting our strategy

Strategies are objects. We can "pull" our strategy out of this hidden strategy environment and save it to `strat`. Now that it is in our global environment, we can look at it. It contains placeholders for assets, indicators, signals, rules, constraints, etc. All things that make sense in a quant trading strategy.


```r
strat &lt;-getStrategy(strategy.st)
summary(strat)
```

```

# Indicators and Quantstrat

How do you decide when to trade? We take market data, such as prices, returns, and fundamentals, are transform them into "smoother" data series that can be short-term or long-term focused. For example, many strategies are related to **trend following**, where you buy things that have been going up and sell things that have been going down. You can also trade on **reversals**, where things that have been going to down go up again, and vice-versa.

These are just price based indicators. You can add in fundamental data to move into and out of stocks, indices, or entire markets based on valuations. You can also rank stocks based on a nearly infinite set of characteristics and use these rankings as your indicators. Buy the highly rated stocks each week or month or quarter and sell the bad ones.

The five steps:

1. Write the `add.indicator()` function.
2. Supply the strategy name (ex. `strategy.st`).
3. Name the function for calculating the indicator (ex. “SMA”).
4. Supply the inputs for the function as a list.
5. Provide a label to your indicator (ex. “SMA200”).


---
# Creating indicators in quantstrat
We can add a single indicator to the strategy that we've created. THe name of the indicator should be in quotes. Be sure that you use descriptive labels for your indicators, or else it can get confusing. I've created both a 200-day and a 50-day moving average and added them to `strategy.st`.


```r
add.indicator(strategy = strategy.st, name = "SMA", arguments = list(x = quote(Cl(mktdata)), n = 200), label = "SMA200")
```

```
## [1] "firststrat"
```

```r
add.indicator(strategy = strategy.st, name = "SMA", arguments = list(x = quote(Cl(mktdata)), n = 50), label = "SMA50")
```

```
## [1] "firststrat"
```

Technical notes:  The "arguments =" part is telling R what arguments or parameters to pass to the SMA function. For example, we want 200-day and 50-day moving averages. When referencing dynamic market data in your add.indicator() call, include mktdata inside the quote() function because it is created inside quantstrat and will change depending on whichever instrument the package is using at the time. quote() ensures that the data can dynamically change over the course of running your strategy. All of this gets fed to the SMA function in a list.

---
# Testing our indicator

The function `applyIndicators()` takes all of the signals that we've added and applies them to our data. In this case, we are passing the SPY data. The `OHLC()` function changes the `xts` data into `OHLC` formated data from the `quantmod` package, or "Open, High, Low, Close". Basically, a stock price specific data type. Type "?OHLC" in the console for more.

Creating a test file like this also lets you visually inspect your data. You could even export it to Excel if you like, as this is just creating an `xts` object.


```r
test &lt;- applyIndicators(strategy = strategy.st, mktdata = OHLC(SPY)) 
tail(test, n = 3)
```

```
##            SPY.Open SPY.High SPY.Low SPY.Close SMA.SMA200 SMA.SMA50
## 2017-12-27   267.38   267.73  267.01    267.32   247.7050  261.0506
## 2017-12-28   267.89   267.92  267.45    267.87   247.8496  261.2986
## 2017-12-29   268.53   268.55  266.64    266.86   247.9915  261.5214
```

---
# Another indicator: Relative Strength Index

The "SMA" indicator is part of the `TTR` package. We can use another indicator from that package called a **relative strength index**. Note that I had to add "price" to the list, instead of "x". The RSI indicator/function is looking for an argument called price.

See this example for more: [https://financetrain.com/quantstrat-example-in-r-rsi-strategy/]


```r
add.indicator(strategy = strategy.st, name = "RSI", arguments = list(price = quote(Cl(mktdata)), n = 3), label = "RSI3")
```

```
## [1] "firststrat"
```

---
# Another indicator: RSI (cont.)


```r
test &lt;- applyIndicators(strategy = strategy.st, mktdata = OHLC(SPY)) 
tail(test, n = 3)
```

```
##            SPY.Open SPY.High SPY.Low SPY.Close SMA.SMA200 SMA.SMA50 rsi.RSI3
## 2017-12-27   267.38   267.73  267.01    267.32   247.7050  261.0506 53.67898
## 2017-12-28   267.89   267.92  267.45    267.87   247.8496  261.2986 74.83837
## 2017-12-29   268.53   268.55  266.64    266.86   247.9915  261.5214 33.13906
```

You can see all of our indicator values together in the test file now.

# From indicators to signals

An indicator is essentially a statistical idea. We are measuring something about an asset at a certain point in time. But, this doesn't tell us when to trade. We need to turn the indicator into a **signal**. In other words, what values must an indicator have in order for us to trade? A signal is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition to actually trade.

What are some examples? Maybe you buy when the 50-day moving average crosses over the 200-day moving average? Or, maybe you buy the highest ROE stocks that are in the lowest quartile of P/CF? Again, coming up with the indicators and the signals is what quantitative traders are spending their time doing.

In `quantstrat`, you use `add.signal`. See the next slide for what you can put into `name = "signal_type"`.


```r
add.signal(strategy.st, name = "signal_type", arguments = list(arguments), label = "label")
```

---
# From indicators to signals (cont.)

There are four types of signals in `quantstrat`.

1. sigComparison : Relationship between two indicators, returns 1 if relationship is true.
2. sigCrossover: Similar to sigComparison, returns 1 on the first occurrence.
3. sigThreshold: Compares range-bound indicator to a static quantity
4. sigFormula: Flexible signal function

**Important**: All signal outputs are either 1s or 0s. Effectively, a signal is either "on" or "off" at any given time, or TRUE or FALSE. 

---
# Creating a trend-following signal

Let's try an example with `sigComparison` and `sigCrossover`. Our first signal, longfilter, will be equal to 1 when the shorter lookback moving average "crosses over" the longer lookback MA (i.e. the 50-day versus 200-day SMA). This is considered a positive signal, so we have named the signal "longfilter". Note that we also have a signal called "filterexit".


```r
add.signal(strategy.st, name = "sigCrossover", arguments = list(columns = c("SMA.SMA50", "SMA.SMA200"), relationship = "gt" ), label = "longfilter")
```

```
## [1] "firststrat"
```

```r
add.signal(strategy.st, name = "sigComparison", arguments = list(columns = c( "SMA.SMA50", "SMA.SMA200"), relationship = "lt"), label = "filterexit")
```

```
## [1] "firststrat"
```

"gt" is greater than, while "lt" is less than. You can use “gt”, “lt”, “eq”, “lte”, or “gte”.

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Buy When Your Two Signals Cross And Then Keep Comparing. Source: DataCamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


---
# Using sigThreshold and RSI

Use `sigThreshold` when your indicator is **bounded** and is compared to critical (and usually fixed) values. For example, when the RSI crosses under 30, or on indicator with running probability value (between 0 and 1), or on rolling ratio’s that is centered on 0. RSI under 30 might indicate that a stock is "oversold", while an RSI above "70" might suggest that it has been "overbought". Buyer beware, etc.


```r
add.signal(strategy.st, name = "sigThreshold", arguments = list(column = "rsi.RSI3", threshold = 30, cross = FALSE, relationship = "lt"), label = "RSILong")
```

```
## [1] "firststrat"
```

```r
add.signal(strategy.st, name = "sigThreshold", arguments = list(column = "rsi.RSI3", threshold = 70, cross = TRUE, relationship = "gt"), label = "RSIShort")
```

```
## [1] "firststrat"
```

`cross = TRUE` is like `sigCrossover`, while `cross = FALSE` is like `sigComparison`. 

---

&lt;img src="img/sig2.png" alt="Buy When Your Single Signal Hits A Certain Threshold. Source: DataCamp." width="75%" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Buy When Your Single Signal Hits A Certain Threshold. Source: DataCamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---
# Flexibility using sigFormula

`sigFormula` allows you to combine various signals together in a flexible manner. For example, maybe you only want to use the RSI signal IF you are in an overall up-trend market (i.e. the 50-day SMA is above the 200-day SMA). Why? The thinking might be that you want to buy in a downturn when the overall trend is up in order to avoid buying in a broader market panic.


```r
add.signal(strategy.st, name = "sigFormula", arguments = list(formula = "RSILong &amp; longfilter", cross = TRUE), label = "longentry")
```

```
## [1] "firststrat"
```

Make sure that the columns in the logical statement are in the strategy prior to the `sigFormula` signal call! In this case, "longthreshold &amp; longfilter". If you don't, `sigFormula` will get confused.

---
# What are rules?

Rules are functions used to create a trade, given you want make one based on a signal. You are going to need entry and exit rules in order to use your indicators and signals to trade. Remember, we are layering items into our strategy. Indicators =&gt; signals =&gt; rules.

We created a signal called "filterexit" that lets us know if the 50-day moving average is less than the 200-day moving average. This is a negative signal, hence the name of the filter. Let's create a **rule** from this signal.


```r
add.rule(strategy.st, name = "ruleSignal", 
         arguments = list(sigcol = "filterexit", sigval = TRUE, orderqty = "all", 
                        ordertype = "market", orderside = "long", 
                        replace = FALSE, prefer = "Open"), 
         type = "exit")
```

```
## [1] "firststrat"
```
---
# What are rules? (cont.)
We have added a rule that will generate orders from a signal in a strategy. This type of rule is added when we include `name = "ruleSignal"` in the `add.rule()` function. Note that we are again passing a bunch of arguments to this rule in a list.

You can read more at: [https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/quantstrat/versions/0.16.7/topics/ruleSignal]

This rule says that when "filterexit" is true (is equal to 1), then place a market order to exit all of your position. The `orderside = "long"` means to use the rule on your long book. So, you'll close out your long position with this rule. We aren't shorting here. The `prefer = "Open"` option tells `quantstrat` to do your trade at the open price on the next day.

Note that `type = "exit"` is **not** part of what is passed to `ruleSignal`. This is an argument for `add.Rule()` itself. 

---
# What are rules? (cont.)

Let's create our entry rule too, from the "longfilter" moving average signal. We'll buy 1000 shares when we enter the trade. You can get much more complicated that that.s


```r
# Create an entry rule of 1 share when all conditions line up to enter into a position
add.rule(strategy.st, name = "ruleSignal", 
         # Use the longentry column as the sigcol
         arguments = list(sigcol = "longfilter", 
         # Set sigval to TRUE
         sigval = TRUE, 
         # Set orderqty to 1000
         orderqty = 1000,
         # Use a market type of order
         ordertype = "market", 
         # Take the long orderside
         orderside = "long", 
         # Do not replace other signals
         replace = FALSE, 
         # Buy at the next day's opening price
         prefer = "Open"), 
         # This is an enter type rule, not an exit
         type = "enter")
```

```
## [1] "firststrat"
```

---
# What are rules? (cont.)

There are other types of rules besures exit and enter. You can also have a **risk** rule that will react to position risk and may halt trading. You can also have **rebalancing** rules, though this doesn't make sense in the strategy we are doing with one security. 

So far, we've created five different indicators, but only two trading rules. The trading rules are based on our simple moving average indicators. Let's go with just those two indicators and see if we can make any money in our **backtest trading the SPY**.

# Our strategy

This is about the simplest momentum/trend strategy that you can come up with.

Buy when: 50-day moving average &gt; 200-day moving average

Sell when: 50-day moving average &lt; 200-day moving average

Does this work? We are going to **apply our strategy**, **update our portfolio**, and, finally, **update our account**.

---
# Our Strategy (cont.)
Let's take a final peak at our strategy object. See the 3 indicators, 5 signals, and 2 rules? That's what we've created above! Again, we are only using 2 of indicators that are used in 2 of our signals that then define our entry and exit rules. We're keeping things "simple".

# Running our strategy

You can use the `applyStrategy()` function to tell `quantstrat` to run a strategy using a certain portfolio. You'll see all of the trades made down in the console. Pretty cool! I also updte the portfolio with these trades, as well as our account. I am giving the account our date range, the length of this backtest. Don't skip this step - you need to do it in order to evaluate your strategy.


```r

# How did we do? (cont.)

We can also make a chart. The blue rectangles indicate periods when we were long the SPY. This is a trend-following strategy, so we were generally long after the financial crisis, unlike some perma-bear hedge fund managers! We also avoided the worst of the financial crisis. The trend is your friend, indeed.


```r
chart.Posn(Portfolio = portfolio.st, Symbol = "SPY")
```

# Pulling out the data that we want

We can bring back the `tidyverse` and take this `tstats` dataframe and pull out what we want.

```r
tab.trades &lt;- tStats %&gt;% 
  mutate(Trades = Num.Trades, 
         Win.Percent = Percent.Positive, 
         Loss.Percent = Percent.Negative, 
         WL.Ratio = Percent.Positive/Percent.Negative) %&gt;% 
  select(Trades, Win.Percent, Loss.Percent, WL.Ratio)

tab.trades
```

```
##   Trades Win.Percent Loss.Percent WL.Ratio
## 1      9    88.88889     11.11111        8
```

# Our returns

We can use the `PortfReturns()` function to get the returns from out account.


```r
rets &lt;- PortfReturns(Account = account.st)
rownames(rets) &lt;- NULL
charts.PerformanceSummary(rets, colorset = bluefocus)
```

&lt;img src="14-trading_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-32-1.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
# Our account

What about our actual trading account with $100,000? How did we do? We can use the `getAccount()` function. You'll see an `a` object in the global environment.


```r
a &lt;- getAccount(account.st)
equity &lt;- a$summary$End.Eq
plot(equity, main = "Equity Curve")
```

&lt;img src="14-trading_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-33-1.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

# What didn't we include?

So much!

- **No taxes or transactions costs.** This is the most important one. These will destroy a strategy that looks good on paper. Lucky for us, `quantstrat` can actually include these by changing some settings. 
- Only one trading signal. You can get much more complex that this.
- No stop losses or any other type of risk system. `quantstrat` can do this too.
